While trying to fulfill the Great Commission, we are constantly having to contend with what I like to call \"the four horsemen of the apocalypse\": our own lusts, the world system, persecution from without, and temptation within. If our desires were aligned with God's, then it could get easier when those oppositional forces emerged but due to fallen nature, the world pulls away from us in virtually everything we do. We are both entrapped in an evil culture while also being the product of that evil culture.\nOf course, if your aim is the holistic sanctification of your soul, the work can sometimes be strenuous but infinitely rewarding. In this short book, I've attempted to provide you with some concrete steps for surviving and thriving in this incredibly unchurched landscape.\nThis chapter comes directly from the introduction to my new eBook The Church In a Post-Christian World (available at Amazon) and is posted here with permission.
