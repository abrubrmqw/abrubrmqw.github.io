There Paul writes that we are to love one another like members of our own family.

The responsibility for the well-being of widows, fatherless children, and the indigent is on the shoulders of all who call themselves Christians, or believers. Many people are blinded by racism, lack of finances, and a lack ofeducation to its role in social reform. It is understood that no Christian can rescue a community from the ravages of poverty as they did two thousand years ago when Jesus walked the land, but still today the Christian can point others towards Christ through love and action, which is a reflection of Christ’s divine Love (Rom 5:1)....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-03-13 11:12:27 +0000 UTC'>March 13, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Is it My Responsibility to Help the Widows and Orphans?" href=https://abrubrmqw.github.io/posts/89634257-is-it-my-responsibility-to-help-the-widows-and-orphans/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>One Key Reason Why Church Consultations Fail</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Church consultations have been an institution since the mid-1980s. They are a significant revenue stream for church consultants. However, these paid consulting assignments tend to be more profitable if they are short and provide only a few pages of recommendations; so consultants are under enormous pressure to sell their clients the shortest possible engagement in order to maximize revenues.

They often feel they need to do it all. Or, as if the problem isn’t a big deal. Or, that it will somehow appear too vulnerable or weak to even ask.
But in order for you to thrive as a leader–and fulfill your calling–you must learn how and when to ask for help. Why? The success of an organization depends on more than just the skills of its leader; it also relies upon the people and resources around them who can take some of the load off so that they can focus on doing what they’re supposed to be doing in the first place....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-03-10 14:30:53 +0000 UTC'>March 10, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Why Pastors Struggle to Ask for Help (And How to Get Past It)" href=https://abrubrmqw.github.io/posts/22580105-why-pastors-struggle-to-ask-for-help-and-how-to-get-past-it/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Why Do Christians Emphasize Hell Instead of Not Being with God in Heaven?</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Many people believe that some people will go to a place called "Hell" after they die.

We have all experienced the debilitating effect that guilt can have on the soul that sins but is also longing for redemption.
