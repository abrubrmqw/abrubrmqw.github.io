Understanding how He saved us gives us the right perspective on heaven; but it also allows us to understand why the Bible is so clear about how it gets into heaven, that is, we get there through Jesus Christ alone (Romans 6:23), by faith.\nHeaven is not a reward for following the law or keeping religious rules. Rather, it is for those who come to Jesus and ask Him for forgiveness. Jesus will forgive them for not following all the old laws and will give them His life which comes from His death upon the Cross. This gift comes to us free of charge when we accept it, which makes us partakers in the inheritance of God (Ephesians 1:18) by adoption (Galatians 4:5). Adoption means we are like sons to God. We are children because of adoption through the blood sacrifice of Christ (Hebrews 9:12-15), just as Abraham's descendants have always been treated like this since they were given circumcision as a sign by God (Genesis 17:10-13). But there is more than this because everyone who believes in Jesus is promised eternal life by Him, with Him forever! (John 6:40). So even if you don't follow any laws, you can still go into heaven without sin and live forever because your soul was redeemed by Jesus' sacrifice when he died on the cross.\nIt may seem strange that someone would believe differently than what is written in scripture but there are reasons behind why people have wrong ideas about going to heaven. It could be due to some cultural influence from other religious systems but mostly I think it has something to do with personal desire because many times I find these false views are created out of selfishness rather than facts found in Scripture.\nBody of Work You've no doubt heard the saying \"There are more stars in heaven than grains of sand on the seashore\". What does it mean? Is it true? When you look at the night sky and see all that glittering light, it looks like an endless expanse where anything could be possible - perhaps this is one reason we believe there must also be infinite possibilities within ourselves! How many times have we thought about what we could achieve, where we could go or who we could become? While we can never know everything there is to know, we shouldn't let our uncertainty limit our potential.\nWe each have unlimited capacity; far beyond what we currently utilize. Those same stars shine down on us every single night offering inspiration and guidance if only we're willing to step into their brilliance long enough to watch them move across our lives... Like seeds carried by wind currents over vast distances - stardust moves throughout our universe carrying hope for wherever they land next. As bumans living below them all this means little more than beauty but maybe there's more here too: consider how closely these two worlds overlap-\n1) Physical World (water, fire, air) vs Spiritual World (stars vs dust),\n2) Earthly objects vs Heavenly ones (rocks vs rocks) ,or 3) Earthlings vs Angelic Beings (humans vs Angels)? Perhaps we share more similarities than differences after all - heavenly realms being no exception. And don't forget its inhabitants! These starry friends embody qualities that mirror their namesake's attributes - sharing wisdom as well as traits such as humility while still possessing bravery amidst adversity which many people lack when compared against life's daily struggles sometimes leading towards feelings of hopelessness for them personally despite knowing better otherwise. While some days may feel like forever before finally ending others can be gone just as quickly making even long ago memories feel fresh again .Everyone experiences different challenges during times varying greatly depending upon one's beliefs \u0026 actions while facing difficult choices makes being human an amazing thing indeed; full of hard work yet filled with joy whenever we choose success rather than defeat even if done alone.
